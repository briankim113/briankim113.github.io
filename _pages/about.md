About
======
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I am advised by [Chao Wang](https://sites.usc.edu/chaowang/). My current research is motivated by my desire to understand software behaviors. More specifically, I am interested in developing software engineering techniques to test and verify if a machine learning model behaves in some desired manner (i.e., robust, fair).

Prior to joining USC, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from New York University Abu Dhabi, where I was advised by [Christina Pöpper](https://poepper.net/). My prior work has been in security and privacy in the domain of mobile browsers.
