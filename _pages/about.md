About
======
I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), where I am advised by [Prof. Chao Wang](https://sites.usc.edu/chaowang/).
My research focuses on **verification and analysis** of critical software components to evaluate complex hyperproperties, such as reliability, security, and fairness.
I'm broadly interested in applying **formal methods and software engineering** techniques to systems from traditional program codes to emerging machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models.
To do this, I leverage techniques such as abstract interpretation, SMT solving, symbolic analysis, and constraint logic programming.

Prior to joining USC, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), where I worked on browser security under [Prof. Christina Pöpper](https://poepper.net/).

You can find a comprehensive overview of my experiences in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vYMhmuqpDhews9zwUTwmF_xekgqTDyQt/view?usp=share_link).
