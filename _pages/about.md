About
======
I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), where I am advised by [Prof. Chao Wang](https://sites.usc.edu/chaowang/).
My research lies at the intersection of **artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering (SE)**.  
Specifically, I work on both *SE for AI* -- evaluating and verifying AI systems for reliability and fairness -- and *AI for SE* -- leveraging AI and large language models (LLMs) to improve program analysis and verification.
I integrate advanced AI techniques with classic SE methods such as SMT solving, symbolic execution, abstract interpretation, and logic programming.

Prior to joining USC, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), where I worked on browser security under [Prof. Christina Pöpper](https://poepper.net/).
