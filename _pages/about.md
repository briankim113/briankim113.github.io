About
======
I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), advised by [Dr. Chao Wang](https://sites.usc.edu/chaowang/).

My research lies at the intersection of **Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. 
My work spans both *SE for AI* -- evaluating and verifying AI systems for reliability and fairness -- and *AI for SE* -- leveraging AI and LLMs to improve program analysis and verification.
Please refer to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bTXSlLyfK77NUlNFE2BHQ3DdVoqIlE4C/view?usp=sharing) for more information.

Prior to joining USC, I graduated cum laude with a B.S. in Computer Science from New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), where I worked on browser security under [Dr. Christina Pöpper](https://poepper.net/).
Outside of work, I enjoy reading, clarinet, and tennis!
